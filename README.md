# CNN Dataset Random Generator

<h2 name="Description">Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
This tool lets you divide your dataset (both images and labels) randomly in three different folders (train, validation and test) and label files. This way you will have everything set to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or other kind of neural network and test it.

The user can select the ratios used to train, validate and test the network and generate the corresponding folders with images and label files with randomly selected images based on these values.

(Still under tidy-up to improve the performance when searching for labels in the label file).</p>

<h2 name="GettingStarted">Getting started</h2>
<p align="justify">
The following step-by-step guide will show you how to download, install and start using DRG. DRG requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or greater to be executed. The .NET Framework 4.5 and later versions are not supported on Windows XP, but on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and later versions of Windows.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or greater, the DRG's Visual Studio project requires <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Microsoft Visual Studio</a> to compile the code (DRG was programmed using Visual Studio Community 2017). This is only needed if you want to tweak the code. If you just want to use DRG as it is, please follow the steps below.
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p align="justify">
To use DRG, first you need to download the latest release. This can be done by clicking on the <a href="https://github.com/jpdominguez/CNN-dataset-random-generator/releases">"releases"</a> button on the <a href="https://github.com/jpdominguez/CNN-dataset-random-generator">home page</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
After the file has been downloaded, decompress it. Place this folder wherever you prefer and double-click DRG.exe to run this tool. If you get an error when trying to execute DRG, please check that the folder from which it is being run contains each of the files that are inside the .zip file (no file has been deleted or moved to another folder) and that your have already installed Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or greater in your computer. If the problem persist, please send me an <a href="mailto:jpdominguez@atc.us.es">email</a> explaining the situation.
