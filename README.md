# CNN Dataset Random Generator

This tool lets you divide your dataset (both images and labels) randomly in three different folders (train, validation and test) and label files. This way you will have everything set to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or other kind of neural network and test it.

The user can select the ratios used to train, validate and test the network and generate the corresponding folders with images and label files with randomly selected images based on these values.

(Still under important changes to improve the poor performance when searching for labels in the label file).
